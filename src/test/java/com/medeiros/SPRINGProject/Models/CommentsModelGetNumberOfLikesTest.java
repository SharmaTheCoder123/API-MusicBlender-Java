Scenario 1: Test to check if the correct number of likes is returned
  Details:
    TestName: testGetNumberOfLikes.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method getNumberOfLikes() returns the correct number of likes that has been previously set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CommentsModel object and set a specific number of likes using the setNumberOfLikes() method.
    Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value matches the number of likes that was set.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getNumberOfLikes() method correctly retrieves the number of likes. The expected result is the correct number of likes, as this would confirm the correct functionality of the method. This test is significant as it ensures that the number of likes is correctly retrieved and displayed to the users.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns zero when no likes are set
  Details:
    TestName: testGetNumberOfLikesWhenNoLikesSet.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method getNumberOfLikes() returns zero when no likes have been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CommentsModel object but do not set any likes.
    Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getNumberOfLikes() method correctly returns zero when no likes have been set. The expected result is zero, as this would confirm the correct functionality of the method when no likes are present. This test is significant as it ensures that the method correctly handles the scenario when no likes are set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method correctly handles negative values
  Details:
    TestName: testGetNumberOfLikesWithNegativeValues.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method getNumberOfLikes() correctly handles negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CommentsModel object and set a negative number of likes using the setNumberOfLikes() method.
    Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes() method.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is zero or a positive number.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if the getNumberOfLikes() method correctly handles negative values. The expected result is zero or a positive number, as likes cannot be negative. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method against invalid input values.
