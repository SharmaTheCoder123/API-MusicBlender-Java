Scenario 1: Testing the retrieval of a command from a LogModel object

Details:
  TestName: testGetComando
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getComando method correctly retrieves the command assigned to a LogModel object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new LogModel object and use the setComando method to assign a command to it.
  Act: Invoke the getComando method on the LogModel object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned command with the one that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getComando method correctly retrieves the command assigned to a LogModel object. This is important to ensure that the correct command is returned, which is crucial for the application's logging functionality.

Scenario 2: Testing the retrieval of a command when no command has been set

Details:
  TestName: testGetComandoWithNoCommandSet
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getComando method behaves when no command has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new LogModel object without setting a command.
  Act: Invoke the getComando method on the LogModel object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned command is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getComando method returns null when no command has been set. This is important for handling situations where a command has not been assigned, and to prevent potential null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 3: Testing the retrieval of a command after it has been changed

Details:
  TestName: testGetComandoAfterChangingCommand
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getComando method fetches the updated command after it has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new LogModel object, set a command, then change the command to something else.
  Act: Invoke the getComando method on the LogModel object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned command with the updated command.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getComando method fetches the updated command after it has been changed. This is important for ensuring that the correct, most recent command is always retrieved.
