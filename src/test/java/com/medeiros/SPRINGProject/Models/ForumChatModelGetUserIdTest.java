Scenario 1: Verify getUserId method returns correct user ID

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserIdReturnsCorrectUserId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUserId method returns the correct user ID that has been previously set using the setUserId method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ForumChatModel class and set a known user ID using the setUserId method.
  Act: Invoke the getUserId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned user ID against the known user ID that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUserId method correctly retrieves the user ID that was set. This is significant to ensure the correct user ID is associated with each forum message.

Scenario 2: Verify getUserId method returns default value when no user ID is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserIdReturnsDefaultValueWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUserId method returns the default value (typically 0 for int) when no user ID has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ForumChatModel class without setting a user ID.
  Act: Invoke the getUserId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned user ID against the default value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUserId method correctly returns the default value when no user ID is set. This is significant in situations where a user ID has not yet been assigned, to prevent unintended behavior or errors.

Scenario 3: Verify getUserId method returns correct user ID after multiple setUserId calls

Details:
  TestName: testGetUserIdReturnsCorrectIdAfterMultipleSetCalls
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getUserId method returns the correct user ID after the setUserId method has been called multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ForumChatModel class and set different user IDs using the setUserId method multiple times.
  Act: Invoke the getUserId method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned user ID against the last user ID that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUserId method correctly retrieves the last user ID that was set, even after multiple changes. This is significant to ensure that the user ID can be accurately updated and retrieved.
