Scenario 1: Validate the returned id from getId method

Details:
    TestName: validateReturnedId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method of the CommentsModel class is returning the correct id, which is previously set using the setId method.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CommentsModel class and set the id using the setId method.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance of CommentsModel.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned id from the getId method against the id that was set.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the getId method is functioning correctly by returning the correct id. The expected result is the id that was set using the setId method. This test is significant in ensuring that the correct id is being returned, which is essential for retrieving the correct comment from the database.

Scenario 2: Validate the returned id when no id is set

Details:
    TestName: validateDefaultId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method of the CommentsModel class is returning the default id when no id is set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CommentsModel class without setting an id.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance of CommentsModel.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned id from the getId method against the default id.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the getId method is returning the default id when no id is set. The expected result is the default id. This test is significant in ensuring that the getId method is handling the scenario when no id is set correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate the returned id after changing the id

Details:
    TestName: validateChangedId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method of the CommentsModel class is returning the correct id after the id is changed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CommentsModel class and set the id using the setId method. Then change the id using the setId method again.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the instance of CommentsModel.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned id from the getId method against the new id that was set.
Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the getId method is returning the correct id after it has been changed. The expected result is the new id that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the getId method is correctly updating the returned id when it is changed.
