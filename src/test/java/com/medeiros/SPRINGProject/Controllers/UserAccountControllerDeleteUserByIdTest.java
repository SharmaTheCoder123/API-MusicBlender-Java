  Scenario 1: Test to check if the user is successfully deleted by id

  Details:
    TestName: testDeleteUserByIdSuccess.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteUserById method is able to successfully delete the user by ID. We assume that the user with the provided ID exists in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the UserAccRepo to return a valid User_Credentials object when the findById method is invoked with a specific ID.
    Act: Invoke the deleteUserById method with the ID of the mocked user.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the deleteUserById invocation is equal to "Conta Deletada".
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the user deletion process was successful. The expected result is "Conta Deletada", which signifies that the user account has been deleted.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the method handles non-existing user deletion attempt

  Details:
    TestName: testDeleteUserByIdNonExistingUser.
    Description: This test is meant to check the deleteUserById method's behavior when attempting to delete a user that does not exist in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the UserAccRepo to return null when the findById method is invoked with a specific ID.
    Act: Invoke the deleteUserById method with the ID of the non-existing user.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the deleteUserById invocation is not equal to "Conta Deletada".
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method communicates the failure to delete a non-existing user. The expected result is not "Conta Deletada", which means the user account has not been deleted because it does not exist.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the method handles invalid ID input

  Details:
    TestName: testDeleteUserByIdInvalidId.
    Description: This test is meant to check the deleteUserById method's behavior when an invalid ID, which cannot be parsed to an integer, is passed as input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to mock UserAccRepo as the method will throw an exception before interacting with the repository.
    Act: Invoke the deleteUserById method with an invalid ID that cannot be parsed to an integer.
    Assert: Assert that a NumberFormatException is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly throws a NumberFormatException when an invalid ID is passed. This is expected because the ID needs to be an integer to interact with the repository.
